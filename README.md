# Flight API use-case

This project evokes the SkyScanner Flight API (with the help of [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) to check the lowest price available for travel between two locations for a specific date.

To accomplish:
- [x] Create basic backend that has initial hardcoded values, but receives correct data using the Skyscanner API
- [x] Add functionality to accept user input using basic HTML
- [ ] Build a front-end with Angular as the framework on-top of backend for user interaction
- [ ] Create basic HTTP client in JavaScript to receive, consolidate, format, and package data before sending response
