# Flight API use-case

This project evokes the SkyScanner Flight API (with the help of [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) to check the lowest price available for travel between two locations for a specific date.

To accomplish:
- [ ] Create basic HTTP client in JavaScript to receive, consolidate, format, and package data before sending response
- [ ] Add functionality to accept user input
- [ ] Build a front-end on top for user interaction
